> *Since 1978, forty U.S. states changed the formulas determining their corporate income tax bases. The most common change has been from a definition of taxable corporate income consisting of payroll, property, and sales within the state, to one consisting solely of sales (``Single Sales Factor Apportionment"). This paper estimates the effects of these changes on a stateâ€™s taxable corporate income. Descriptive evidence suggests that taxable corporate income increases initially following the policy adoption; however, using a combination of two-way fixed effects, difference-in-differences, and synthetic approaches, I estimate that corporate income generally remains unchanged or declines over time, with most effects negative but statistically insignificant.*
