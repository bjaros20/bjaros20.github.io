About Me

I am a Ph.D candidate in Economics in the the John E. Walker Department of Economics at Clemson University.  My research interests are in public finance, financial economics, and economic history.  I am particularly interested in federal, state, and local tax policy.   My current research focuses on state and local tax policy and state tax credits and incentives.
 
If you have any questions about my work or would like to contact me, feel free to do so.


About the Site

On this site you will find my CV and other items for the Job Market, links to my projects in Github, and my tax blog, which includes my less formal, but perhaps instructive observations in the tax policy space.
